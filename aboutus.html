                <!-- Information about Larami's specialization -->
                we were specialized in low-cost, low-quality licensed toys based on popular movies
                and television shows during the 1960s and 1970s, toy guns, and toy water guns. 
                launched the Super Soaker brand in 1991. This gun is no match for any of the
                newer guns, but can be a good sniper gun. With a small nozzle, this gun fires 50 feet!
                Thus, it has the name: SS50. Actually, this gun was originally called the SS 100, until 
                the actual SS 100 came out, and the name was changed to SS50 due to the sheer size of the SS 100
